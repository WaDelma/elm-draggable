{-| Register a `DragStart` event listener. It will not trigger if the mouse has not moved while it was pressed. It receives the element key.
-}
onDragStart : (a -> msg) -> Event a msg
onDragStart toMsg config =
    { config | onDragStart = Just << toMsg }


{-| Register a `DragEnd` event listener. It will not trigger if the mouse has not moved while it was pressed.
-}
onDragEnd : msg -> Event a msg
onDragEnd toMsg config =
    { config | onDragEnd = Just toMsg }


{-| Register a `DragBy` event listener. It will trigger every time the mouse is moved. The sent message will contain a `Delta`, which is the distance between the current position and the previous one.

    case Msg of
        OnDragBy ( dx, dy ) ->
            { model | position = { x = position.x + dx, y = position.y + dy } }

onDragBy : (Delta -> msg) -> Event a msg
onDragBy toMsg config =
    { config | onDragBy = Just << toMsg }


{-| Register a `Click` event listener. It will trigger if the mouse is pressed and immediately release, without any move. It receives the element key.
-}
onClick : (a -> Int -> msg) -> Event a msg
onClick toMsg config =
    { config | onClick = compose2 Just toMsg }


{-| Register a `MouseDown` event listener. It will trigger whenever the mouse is pressed and will indicate the target element by the given key.
-}
onMouseDown : (a -> Int -> msg) -> Event a msg
onMouseDown toMsg config =
    { config | onMouseDown = compose2 Just toMsg }
